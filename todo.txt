Needed skillset: 
- type conversion and interpretation
- pointers to functions

rework all names to match snake case

Set (BT)
HashMap
HashLinkedList
HashSet
Graph

Replace each of above with generic version - Idea, have constructor require pointer to a function that casts (void *) to appropriate type, and a comparator

Implement relevant algorithm to each DS

Idea for hash: One constructor takes pointer to hash function or a setter to the hash function
