# Current Status

UPDATE (10/16/23): I'm slowly updating this repository as I'm working on finishing my PhD.

# c_ds_algo
Basic Data Structures and Algorithms needed to code good C programs. This idea came out of a realization that I was always reimplementing data structures from scratch when coding in C. This is improved in C++, but this bare-bones library is a compromise for those who want to stay in C. 

The initial goal was to have less verbose code by simulating OOP concepts, but that defeats the purpose of C. This implementation is not as verbose as you'd expect, but still has some verboseness to it. Once the core algorithms are implemented, I will be using macros to improve readability (or anything that is done at compile time).


# Disclaimer
None of the code has been tested yet. Bugs likely to exists at the moment
