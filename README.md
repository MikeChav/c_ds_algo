# c_ds_algo
Basic Data Structures and Algorithms needed to code good C programs

None of the code has been tested yet. Bugs likely to exists at the moment

UPDATE (10/16/23): I'll be updating this repository when I finish my PhD (in ~8 months).

UPDATE: scrapped old code after realizing it was full of problems. 
I am seeing several ways of implementing this and I will document my decisions and potentially write several versions
